# Overview
    The python portion is split among 3 files, PythonPart1, PythonPart2A, PythonPart2B. 
    PythonPart1 is the code to find the relative frequency of total cell count for each sample. 
    PythonPart2A is an excel sheet with all the boxplots and how I used the data to make them.
    PythonPart2B are my assumptions based on the excel sheet boxplots.
    
    The second portion of the techinal assessment is all in one file called database. That is where I provide the 
    xml code to create the database and queries.

# Running PythonPart1
    First provide a cell-count.cvs file within the same project. Since cell-count.cvs is already coded to be read, 
    running the code will then provide an output file in CSV format with cell count and relative frequency of each 
    population of each sample per line.
